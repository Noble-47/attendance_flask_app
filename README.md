- **Admin Interface:** The app includes an admin interface that allows authorized users to:
  - Schedule classes for students.
  - Monitor attendance in real-time with live updates.

- **Student Interface:** The student interface provides functionalities for students to:
  - Enroll in classes.
  - Sign in to their accounts.
  - Register attendance in specific classes.

- **Custom Command:** The project also includes a custom command for creating admin users with appropriate privileges.
